Currently ONLY supports 22.11 dl version of Halcon installation cause that's what I'm running.

1) Need to have python installed in your machine.  
2) Make sure you have "requests" package. Run `pip install requests` if don't have.  
3) Open elevated cmd from script directory. Run `py auto-fetch-halcon-license.py`.
